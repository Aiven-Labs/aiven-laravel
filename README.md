# Aiven Commands for Laravel

**✨ Add some Aiven magic to your Laravel project ✨**

This Laravel package provides some `aiven` commands for `artisan` to help with managing your development databases and producing the correct configuration to use with them. This version supports both MySQL and PostgreSQL.

Use the commands to:
* List the Aiven services in your project
* Power your databases on and off from `artisan`, so you don't leave the meter running when you're not working
* Get database config you can paste straight into your `.env` file or environment.

## Getting started

Install the package with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org):

```
composer require aiven/aiven-laravel
```

You will need an Aiven account - [sign up for a free trial](https://console.aiven.io/signup?utm_source=github&utm_medium=aiven-laravel) if you don't have one already. Go ahead and create the database(s) you'll be using in your project through the web interface, or investigate the [Aiven CLI](https://developer.aiven.io/docs/tools/cli).

Get an [auth token](https://developer.aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token) for your Aiven account, and set it as `AIVEN_API_TOKEN` in your environment.

It's recommended to also set `AIVEN_DEFAULT_PROJECT` as the project in your Aiven account that you'll be using services from (but you can also supply `--project [projectname]` for all the commands instead if you like)

## Usage

Get a list of the Aiven services (databases) available:

```
php artisan aiven:list 
```

Get the environment variables to export or paste into `.env` for a particular service:

```
php artisan aiven:getconfig --service my-postgres-db
```

> When you use the `DATABASE_URL` in Laravel, you must remove the existing `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, etc configuration so that it does not conflict.

Check the status of the service:

```
php artisan aiven:state --service my-postgres-db
```

Power the service on or off:
```
php artisan aiven:powerup --service my-postgres-db
php artisan aiven:powerdown --service my-postgres-db
```

It's useful to power things down when you're not using them so that you aren't being charged (even if you're still paying in trial credits!)

## Datastore-specific setup

### MySQL and PostgreSQL

PHP is on good terms with relational databases, and Laravel makes this very straight forward.

1. Remove all the configuration entries from `.env` starting with `DB_`

2. Paste the output of the `aiven:getconfig` command. For both MySQL and PostgreSQL, this is a `DATABASE_URL`. For PostgreSQL, we need to tell Laravel we want to use Postgres (MySQL is the default) so the command also outputs `DB_CONNECTION=pgsql` and this should also be included.

### Redis

Redis needs some extra dependencies (see [Laravel Redis docs](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/redis)), and then you can set the `REDIS_URL` to the value returned by `aiven:getconfig`.

### OpenSearch with Laravel Scout

This uses some Elasticsearch libraries because the OpenSearch project is a fork so they are reasonably compatible.

* Use [Laravel Scout](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/scout)

* Add [Explorer](https://jeroen-g.github.io/Explorer/)

* Pin your PHP elasticsearch library dependencies, I have this in `composer.json`:

```
        "elasticsearch/elasticsearch": ">=7.9 <7.14",
```

The `aiven:getconfig` command will give you just the connection string for an OpenSearch service; put this in the `config/explorer.php` so that it looks something like this:

```
    'connection' => "https://avnadmin:s3cr3t@servicename.aivencloud.com:port",
```

The Scout documentation has a good overview of how to make your models searchable, and the Explorer project adds commands to create the index.

## Troubleshooting

### MySQL primary key errors

Laravel's initial migrations assumes that your MySQL database doesn't enforce primary keys (see [related bug](https://github.com/laravel/framework/issues/33238) for more info) - disable the `mysql.sql_require_primary_key` setting on Aiven if you run into this.

### Connection problems

If you add the config to your environment and still can't connect, check that you don't have other environment variables with names starting `DB_` ... values like `DB_HOST` should be removed when you use the `DATABASE_URL` field to connect.
